Apache Hive 4 Setup

This script will download / setup Apache Hive 4 standalone WITHOUT Cloudera Manager
Hive Metastore uses Apache Derby and HiveServer2 is configured to use the TEZ engine

In case of ClassNotFound / MethodNotFound use the findJar / findJarByClass / linkJar
We assume you know bash scripting ;)

Beeline is to be executed as follows:

su - hive
beeline

Execution Time: 5-10 minutes. 
Be patient as the packages are being downloaded on the fly

Monitoring: View LOGS on the squadron UI.

Note - This script will *NOT* work if CDH / CDP is installed, be sure to use a single plain CentOS 7 node

Please check LOGS button on the Squadron UI to view the Ansible playbook logs for the same.

Also check /tmp/install.log

If you face any issues, please ping in "prod_squadron" slack chatroom with error logs.
